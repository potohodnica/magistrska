The test.csv doesn't contain the target variable and hence the model can't be trainied on that. The target (label column) is only present in train.csv. Hence, we will split the data in the training set (training.csv) into two parts - training set (for training the model) and test set (for validation). To do so, we will use train_test_split() method from sklearn.model_selection. This method takes in the features (X) and label column (y) separately in the first 2 parameters. The 3rd parameter is test_size, which we can set in order to specify with what percentage we want to split our data. We are going to use \"0.1\" as the argument value. This will split our data into 90% training and 10% test sets. The 4th parameter is the random_state. This is an optional parameter which you will find as a part of many ML algorithms.

It's with hit and trial that you develop an intiution of how many layers (or neurons) a particular problem may require to get to the desired solution. You can play with the number of layers and neurons (numbers like 128, 224 etc) and see how the network is responsding to your changes.\n",

        "input_channels: input_channels refers to the number of channels the input has. If our dataset contained colored images, this argument would have been equal to 3.

        "output_channels: output_channels is arbitrary number and can be set to any number you want. It basically sets the number of neurons that its input_channels would be connected to. It also sets the input_channels of the next convolution layer. So, output_channel (previous layer) = input_channel (next layer)\n",
        "\n",
        "kernel_size: kernel_size is a square matrix of a particular width and height. When we set the third parameter to 5, it basically means we are setting the square kernel of size 5 x 5. A kernel can be thought of as a window (matrix) that slides over our image to extract certain features out of it in order to learn. That's why kernels are also called as feature maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's anther parameter that we haven't explicitly defined but by default is set to 1, and that is 'stride'. A stride means by how much the kernel should slide in order to output the next feature map. stride = 1 essentially means that it will slide by 1 pixel to right and 1 pixel to down.\n",

        "Q. What is pooling?\n",
        "\n",
        "A. Pooling is another type of layer in a neural network that down samples the feature maps created by the convolution layer. It basically summarises a portion of the image in a much lesser space. It is done to reduce variance and computations. But why Max-pooling? It's because max-pooling helps in extracting low-level features like edges, points, etc. There are other type of pooling methods such as average pooling and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q. What is the importance of view() function in the forward() method?\n",
        "\n",
        "A. The view() function takes in a tensor (for ex a 4D tensor) and outputs a lower dimensional tensor (for example a 1D tensor). This is required because the next set of layers are the linear layers. And linear layers only accept a 1D tensor (a \"flattened\" array) as an input. So, the view function is used to flatten the tensor so that it can then be fed to the linear layers.\n",

        "\n",
        "For now, consider it as something that tells our model to not cross a certain boundry (threshold). Because if it does, it will be overfitted. Overfiting is a problem that machine learning algortihms face when the model is 'too exact' to be used for actual real world data. That simply means that our model, when overfitted, wouldn't be accurate in preidction task when a new datapoint is fed into the model (for example a datapoint from the test dataset). So, in order to avoid overfitting, we use regularization. This is just an intuition. We don't need to get into the math of anything for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout is one of the regularization methods. Dropout helps avoid overfitting by simply 'switching off' some of the neurons in a particular iteration. Sometimes, the outup of a particular neuron from a particular layer can shoot off to a high value or to a very low value. So, the dropout method helps the network to consider some of the other neurons that it might have been ignoring because of their lower valued outputs. So, by simply turning off some neurons, it makes sure that it takes into account every neuron and hence train in a more vigorous manner and hence avoid overfitting.\n",

        "\n",
        "A. RelU is short for Rectified Linear Unit. RelU and Softmax are both activation functions. What are activation functions, you ask? Well, they can be thought of as something that restricts the values of the neurons after computations to explode to extremes (very high negative or very high positive) values. Activation functions makes sure the values are bounded within a range. For example, the relu function makes sure the values are between (0,max(val)) range, where 'val' is the actual value of the neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q. But why only relu and Softmax are chosen?\n",
        "\n",
        "A. You can choose any activation function you want. However, recent researches proves that relu performs well in almost all the cases as comapred to other activation functions. tanh is another very commonly used activation function. We don't have the luxury of choosing just any activation function when it comes to the output layer. We want to choose an activation function according to our desired output. We have chosen softmax because softmax gives out a class score for every class which is basically a probablity distribution that in turn tells us how confident is the neural network about a certain class to be the actual output.\n",

        "Note: The two modules imported from the torch library: nn and functional can be used interchangeable. Having said that, all the functions that are present in the nn module are there in the functional module as well. The only difference is the names of these funtions.\n",

        "\n",
        "A neural network 'learns' by adjusting various parameters through out the network. Weight is one of the paramter that the neural network learns to adjust. Weight is simply the strength of the two adjoining neurons that it is connected to and it is a numeric value. The new weight values are updated duriing backpropagation process. Now, the thing to note here is, how are these new values calculated?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answer is: with the help of loss functions.\n",
        "\n",
